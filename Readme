Travigo Website Migration Project
Project Context
To enhance its online presence, Travigo, a leading travel agency, aims to migrate from a single-page website to a multi-page platform. This transition will allow for better content organization, improved user engagement, and a more comprehensive presentation of the company's offerings.

The product owner will organize a meeting with the development team to outline the companyâ€™s needs and validate your proposals.

Project Objectives
As a web integrator, your responsibility is to implement the following modifications:

1. New "Tours" Page
Develop a dedicated page showcasing Travigo's various travel destinations. This page should include destination descriptions, imagery, and any additional relevant information.
2. New "About Us" Page
Create an "About Us" page providing detailed information about Travigo, including company history, values, team members, and mission statement.
3. New "Contact Us" Page
Implement a "Contact Us" page featuring a form where users can submit feedback or inquiries. Ensure the form captures essential details and functions seamlessly. Include company contact information as well.
4. HTML/CSS Development
Integrate the newly developed pages using HTML and CSS. The pages should be added to the site's main navigation menu, ensuring consistent design and functionality across the site.
5. SEO Enhancements (Optional)
Implement at least three SEO optimizations to improve the site's search engine ranking. Suggestions include:
Improving meta tags (titles, descriptions).
Enhancing page loading speed.
Structuring URLs and internal links for better SEO performance.
6. Logo Proposal
Design a new logo that aligns with Travigo's visual identity and branding guidelines, enhancing the site's overall aesthetic.
